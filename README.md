## Source code

This repository contains the Java projects that make up the Micro-Manager
"MMStudio" GUI application. The device control layer is written in C++ and found
in a separate repository,
[mmCoreAndDevices](https://github.com/micro-manager/mmCoreAndDevices),
which is currently a git submodule of this repository.

To checkout both repositories together:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/micro-manager/micro-manager.git
```

If you will be making changes to the code, make sure to **enable pre-commit
hooks** as described in [doc/pre-commit.md](doc/pre-commit.md).
