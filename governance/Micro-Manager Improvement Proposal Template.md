## **Abstract**

<!-- The abstract should be a short description of what the MMIP will achieve. -->


## **Motivation and Scope**

<!-- This section describes the need for the proposed change. It should describe the existing problem, who it affects, what it is trying to solve, and why. This section should explicitly address the scope of and key requirements for the proposed change. -->


## **Detailed description**

<!-- This section should provide a detailed description of the proposed change. It should include examples of how the new functionality would be used, intended use-cases, and pseudocode illustrating its use. -->


## **Implementation**


<!-- This section lists the major steps required to implement the MMIP. Where possible, it should be noted where one step is dependent on another, and which steps may be optionally omitted. Where it makes sense, each step should include a link related pull requests as the implementation progresses. -->

<!-- Any pull requests or development branches containing work on this MMIP should be linked to from here. (A MMIP does not need to be implemented in a single pull request if it makes sense to implement it in discrete phases). -->


## **Backward compatibility**

This section describes the ways in which the MMIP breaks backward compatibility.
