# **Roles**


### **Community**

Anyone using and/or developing the Micro-Manager software is part of the "Micro-Manager community".  All companies producing hardware that can be used with Micro-Manager as well as everyone controlling microscopes with software are warmly invited to be part of this community. 


### **Contributors**

A community member can become a contributor by interacting directly with the project in concrete ways, such as:



* proposing a change to the code via a GitHub pull request;
* reporting issues on our GitHub issues page;
* proposing a change to the documentation or website via a GitHub pull request;
* Asking and answering usage questions on [image.sc](https://forum.image.sc/tag/micro-manager)
* discussing the design of the website, software, and APIs in existing issues and pull requests
* reviewing open pull requests

among other possibilities. Any community member can become a contributor, and all are encouraged to do so. By contributing to the project, community members can directly help to shape its future


### **Core developer**

Core developers are contributors that have demonstrated continued commitment to the project through ongoing contributions. They have shown they can be trusted to maintain Micro-Manager with care. Becoming a core developer allows contributors to merge approved pull requests, cast votes for and against merging a pull-request, and be involved in deciding major changes to the API, and thereby more easily carry on with their project related activities. Core developers appear as organization members on the Micro-Manager GitHub organization, and will have “owner” permissions for the Micro-Manager organization on Github. Core developers are expected to review code contributions while adhering to the core developer guide. Core developers are also strongly encouraged to share their expertise with other community members by answering questions on the [image.sc](https://forum.image.sc/tag/micro-manager) forum. 

Core developers may make changes to the governance docs that are related to development workflows (for example, the [core developer guide](https://github.com/micro-manager/micro-manager/blob/main/governance/Core%20Developer%20Guide.md), when to merge a pull request, etc.). However, larger changes (such as changes the Mission or voting procedures) must be done by the steering council (see below).

New core developers can be nominated by any existing core developer. Discussion about new core developer nominations is one of the few activities that takes place on private email. The decision to invite a new core developer must be made by “lazy consensus”, meaning unanimous agreement by all responding existing core developers. Invitation must take place at least one month after initial nomination, to allow existing members time to voice any objections.[ \

#### Inviting New Core Developers

Any core member may nominate other contributors to join the core team. Nominations happen in private email communications. As of this writing, there is no hard-and-fast rule about who can be nominated; at a minimum, they should have: been part of the project for at least six months, contributed significant changes of their own, contributed to the discussion and review of others’ work, and collaborated in a way befitting our community values.


### **Steering council**

The Steering Council (SC) members ensure the smooth running of the project. SC members may also be Core Developers. While the core developers handle technical issues amongst themselves, SC members are expected to participate in strategic planning, approve major changes to the governance model, and make decisions about funding granted to the project itself. (Funding to community members is theirs to pursue and manage.) The purpose of the SC is to ensure smooth progress from the big-picture perspective. Changes that impact the full project require analysis informed by long experience with both the project and the larger ecosystem. If the core developers (including those who are also SC members) fail to reach such a consensus in a reasonable timeframe, the SC is the entity that resolves the issue by majority vote. If an even number of members are on the steering council, the a vote of the core developers will break ties. If there are both an even number of core developers and an even number of steering council members, coin flips are used to break ties.

When conflicts of interest arise in decisions made by the SC (e.g. if a particular decision would directly benefit a SC member’s company), members are expected to recuse themselves from voting.

The SC membership is revisited as needed. SC members who do not actively engage with the SC duties are expected to resign. New members are added by nomination by a core developer. Nominees should have demonstrated long-term, continued commitment to the project and its mission. A nomination will result in discussion that cannot take more than a month and then admission to the SC by consensus.

The initial steering council consists of: Nico Stuurman, Mark Tsuchida, Henry Pinkard, Kevin Eliceiri, Jon Daniels and Nenad Amodaj


# **Decision making process**

Decisions about the future of the project are made through discussion with all members of the community. All non-sensitive project management discussion takes place on the Github page appropriate to the project, or if done through face-to-face/video conference meetings, a summary of these discussions will be posted to Github. Occasionally, sensitive discussion may occur on a private list or in face-to-face/video conference meetings.

Decisions should be made in accordance with the Mission and Vision of the project, and should be judged on their technical merit, not in the interests of any outside entity.

Micro-Manager uses a “consensus seeking” process for making decisions. The group tries to find a resolution that has no open objections among core developers. Core developers are expected to distinguish between fundamental “objections” to a proposal and minor perceived “flaws” that they can live with, and not hold up the decision-making process for the latter. They should try to specifically use terms “objections” and “flaws” whenever possible in discussions in order to make their stances clear. If, after discussion, no option can be found without objections, the decision on the proposal will be put to a simple majority vote of the core developers. 

Decisions are made according to the following rules:


* **Minor documentation changes**, such as typo fixes, or addition / correction of a sentence require approval by a core developer _and_ no disagreement or requested changes by a core developer on the issue or pull request page (lazy consensus). Core developers are expected to give “reasonable time” to others to give their opinion on the pull request if they’re not confident others would agree.
* **Code changes and major documentation changes** require agreement by _two_ core developers _and_ no disagreement or requested changes by a core developer on the issue or pull-request page (lazy consensus).
* **New major versions and big picture roadmaps of MMStudio, MMCore (including its language bindings) and/or MMDevice,** require a **formal** [**Micro-Manager Improvement Proposal**](https://github.com/micro-manager/micro-manager/blob/main/governance/Micro-Manager%20Improvement%20Proposals.md)
* **Changes to this governance model or Micro-Manager’s [Mission and Vision](https://github.com/micro-manager/micro-manager/blob/main/governance/Micro-Manager%20Improvement%20Proposal%20Template.md)** are automatically elevated to the Steering Council
