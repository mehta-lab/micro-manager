# **Micro-Manager Improvement Proposals (MMIPs)**

Micro-Manager Improvement Proposals are meant to be used for larger projects. Smaller changes and improvements can simply exist as GitHub issues. Anything that would make major backwards incompatible changes, provide new paradigms for using Micro-Manager, or change major processes with which the project functions should have a corresponding MMIP. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Micro-Manager development.

Their purpose is twofold: 1) To provide a high-level overview/roadmap for major changes to Micro-Manager with a succinct, organized view of all of the relevant GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, etc. This allows community members to quickly navigate around the relevant parts which may be split across many github issues. They not only provide a historical record of when and how major changes to Micro-Manager took place, they also provide a roadmap for where the project is going. Large proposals will likely have many sub-parts, each of which may itself have one or more GitHub issues containing discussions and improvements.

Each Improvement proposal must have a championâ€”someone who writes the proposal using the style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea.

**Workflow**



* Champion writes up an initial proposal, which is quickly merged into the micro-manager repository in the MMIP folder (regardless of whether the proposal will be changed and/or ultimately accepted). Additional PRs may be made by the author to update or expand the MMIP, or by maintainers to set its status, discussion URL, etc. Regardless of whether the MMIP is implemented, it will remain in this folder.
* Champion leads discussion during which they seek to build consensus around the ideas by soliciting feedback from other developers and the community
* Any issues that cannot be agreed upon are written up, an announcement is made to put each of them to a vote amongst core developers, where it will be accepted/rejected/withdrawn.
