Micro-Manager is an open source software platform for optical microscopy image acquisition and device control. It aims to provide a consistent and reliable user interface for routine microscopy experiments across a diverse array of microscope hardware, as well as a powerful set of customizable and extensible programmatic building blocks for enabling various types of microscopy.

Micro-manager strives to achieve these goals by being:

- **Easy to install and use** with minimal technical knowledge
- **Free and open source** with all components available under Open Source Initiative-approved licenses (with limited exceptions for proprietary, hardware vendor-specific code)
- **Community-driven** both in terms of code contributions, support, and the development of new features. The community includes users, developers, and vendors of microscopy hardware.
- **Inclusive.** We continue to welcome and mentor newcomers who are making their first contribution.
- **Adaptable** to be used on a variety of types of hardware through a consistent, stable API
- **Performant** so it can used with cutting edge applications
